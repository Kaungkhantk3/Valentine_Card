- PERFORMANCE & ARCHITECTURE RULES (IMPORTANT)
-
- This is an image-heavy, canvas-based Valentine Card editor.
- Lighthouse performance is a concern (current score ~56).
-
- Rules for any code you generate:
- 1.  Do NOT eagerly load heavy features (canvas, editor logic, unlock animations).
- - Use lazy loading, conditional rendering, or dynamic import.
-
- 2.  Preview assets (videos / animated webp / gifs) MUST be loaded
- only when the manual modal or preview is opened.
-
- 3.  Avoid expensive work during initial render.
- - No canvas initialization on page load.
- - No heavy loops in useEffect without guards.
-
- 4.  For interactions (drag, hold, scratch):
- - Do NOT call setState on every pointer move.
- - Use requestAnimationFrame or refs where possible.
-
- 5.  Optimize images:
- - Prefer WebP
- - Max display size ~1080px
- - Main visual = LCP, load it first.
-
- 6.  Mobile Safari is the primary target.
-
- Generate code that follows these rules.
